				<h5>OpenNIC?</h5>
				<p>OpenNIC is a user owned and controlled Network Information Center offering a democratic, non-national, alternative to the traditional Top-Level Domain registries. Users of OpenNIC DNS servers, in addition to resolving host names in the legacy ICANN DNS, can resolve host names in the OpenNIC operated namespaces with which we have peering agreements.</p>
				<p>ModernTLD currently provides services and registrations for the “.o” TLD on the OpenNIC network, with more TLDs in the works.</p>
				<p>While OpenNIC may seem confusing to many new users, it’s quite simple to setup and start browsing. By following some <a href="https://www.moderntld.com/get-started/">simple guides</a> you can be up and running in no time!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col s12 l6">
				<h5>Why won't ".o" sites load?</h5>
				<p>“.o” exists on an alternative DNS network called OpenNIC. While we are the largest growing alternative root zone on the internet, many users still cannot access the TLDs we provide. You can access our domains easily by <a href="https://www.moderntld.com/get-started/">changing some simple settings</a> on your computer or router.</p>
				<p>OpenNIC works best by supplementing existing domains on the ICANN network, unless you are certain all your users will be able to change their DNS servers. In the future we will be offering services that make this transition much easier.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, if you're certain your computer is configured correctly, it may be the fault of the server operator. Try some websites that are more likely to be online, such as <a href="http://example.o">example.o</a>, <a href="http://opennic.o">opennic.o</a>, or <a href="http://be.libre">be.libre</a>.</p>

				<h5>Can I support ModernTLD in any way?</h5>
				<p>The best way to help us is donating Bitcoin to the following address: 16HiDkcj8oYLv5LnfjMa5qzWmY1xEVcuog</p>
				<p>Your contributions will help us keep the registration and <a href="https://www.moderntld.com/infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> services we provide up and running for everybody, and keep your domain’s uptime guaranteed.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can purchase premium services (coming soon) or volunteer to help the OpenNIC project by donating or providing a T2 DNS server. <a href="https://www.opennicproject.org/">Learn more about providing a server on OpenNIC’s homepage</a>.</p>
