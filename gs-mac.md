2. Double-Click on the “Network” icon.

4. Enter two or more OpenNIC DNS server IP address, preferably ones nearest to your location, which you can find [here](https://servers.opennicproject.org/). Alternatively, you're welcome to use **198.251.90.143** and **138.197.25.214**, the official ModernTLD DNS servers.

5. Apply your settings by clicking the “Apply Now” button.

That's all! You're now configured to access any ModernTLD or OpenNIC website!
