**Computer Configuration and Registration!**

### DNS Configuration

Accessing ModernTLD Websites, including our registration pages, requires changing your DNS settings on your computer. Don’t worry, these steps are easy: Just follow these simple steps and you’ll be on your way!

**Step 1.** Choose your [DNS servers](/infrastructure)! You can use the following two:

- 45.76.27.27 (IPv6: 2001:19f0:5c01:405::53)
- 138.197.25.214 (IPv6: 2604:a880:800:10::1f02:d001)

Or you can grab two random ones from [this list](https://servers.opennicproject.org/), it doesn’t matter.

**Step 2.** Follow one of these guides to change your settings.
