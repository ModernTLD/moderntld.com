**Computer Configuration and Registration!**

### DNS Configuration

Accessing OpenNIC Websites, including our registration pages, requires changing your DNS settings on your computer. Don’t worry, these steps are easy: Just follow these simple steps and you’ll be on your way!

**Step 1.** Choose your [DNS servers](/infrastructure)! You can use the following two:

* 198.251.90.143 (ModernTLD Anycast Server)
* 185.121.177.177 (Fusl's Anycast Server)

Alternatively, if you need IPv6 DNS servers or want to find a more local server to your location, you can also use any server listed on [the official OpenNIC server list](https://servers.opennicproject.org/).

**Step 2.** Follow one of these guides to change your settings.

- [Windows 7, 8, 10](/get-started/windows)
- [MacOS](/get-started/mac)
