### Connecting

If you have an IRC client you can use, you can use the following information to connect to our chat:

- Server: chat.freenode.net:6697 (use SSL)
- Channel: #ModernTLD

Also if youâ€™re interested, you can join #opennic on the same server to chat with the OpenNIC community as a whole.

No idea what any of that means? If you just want a simple chat just login to our webchat below:
