ModernTLD is a project maintained by a group of volunteers to promote the OpenNIC network and the importance of a democratically controlled internet system.

We currently operate the “.o” TLD on the OpenNIC network. To find out more about how “.o” is governed, read our charter.

This project is governed democratically by domain holding members. Domain holding is free and doesn’t require personal verification, simply register a domain and you’re set. Because of the potential for abuse of our governing system, ModernTLD administration holds the right to veto decisions that could cause instability of our network.
