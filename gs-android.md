### DNS Servers

Before you begin, you will need to choose two DNS servers. You can either pick from [this list](https://servers.opennic.org/), or use these two:

* 198.251.90.143 (ModernTLD Anycast Server)
* 138.197.25.214 (ModernTLD New York Server)

### Setup Guide

**Note:** These instructions will prevent you from using a VPN service simultaneously. We are working on a solution. In the meantime, if you require the use of another VPN service you can change DNS settings manually in Settings, but it will only apply on WiFi connections, not 3G/4G.

1. Download [DNS Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burakgon.dnschanger) from the Google Play Store.
2. Under Choose a DNS Provider, select Custom DNS (Enter manually).
3. Enter the IP addresses you chose before starting this guide into the DNS 1 and DNS 2 fields in DNS Changer.
4. Press Start. Allow the app to create a VPN network.

That's all! You're now configured to access any ModernTLD or OpenNIC website!
