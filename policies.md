### Organizational Policies

#### Voting

All matters of administrative importance will be voted upon by members of the mTLD domain registry. Votes on amending or creating new policies may be started by any member at any time simply by posting the proposal to the ModernTLD mailing list. It will be available for review and editing until the proposing member pushes it forward to a vote. Motions will be passed by a simple majority of votes. The mTLD administration holds the right to veto any member votes, in order to retain control of .o operation.

### Future

The modernTLD administration is committed to the future of the OpenNIC network and will attempt to provide, in addition to the .o Tier 1 server, Tier 2 DNS servers to support the OpenNIC infrastructure, a search engine for the network, email services, SSL services (under a self-hosted root CA). These services have no deadline for completion at the moment. We also wish to help in spreading the word about OpenNIC via self promotion and joining the Public Relations Working Group: http://wiki.opennicproject.org/PublicRelationsWG.
