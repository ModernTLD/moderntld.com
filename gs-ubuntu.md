### DNS Servers

Before you begin, you will need to choose two DNS servers. You can either pick from [this list](https://servers.opennic.org/), or use these two:

* 198.251.90.143 (ModernTLD Anycast Server)
* 138.197.25.214 (ModernTLD New York Server)

*[More info](/infrastructure)*

### Setup Guide

1. Left-click Network Manager icon from the System Tray

2. Click "Edit Connections" from the menu

3. Select the appropriate tab ("Wired/Wireless") depending on your connection

4. Double-click your connection

5. Select the IPv4 or IPv6 tab depending on your connection (if you're not sure, you're probably using IPv4)

6. Change the "Method" to "Automatic (DHCP) addresses only"

7. In the DNS servers box, enter the two DNS servers you choose before starting this guide.

8. Click "Save"

9. Disconnect and reconnect to your network; restart your browser.

That's all! You're now configured to access any ModernTLD or OpenNIC website!
